# PowerShell Deployment Scripts

A collection of PowerShell scripts I've developed to automate the deployment of Windows across multiple college machines. These scripts streamline tasks like configuring system settings, installing applications, and enabling essential featuresâ€”all with minimal effort.

Feel free to use or modify these for your own projects! ðŸ˜Š
